# Overview

Between 2019 and 2022, OlO-Mango generated $28M in total sales from 108,000 orders, with an average order value (AOV) of $260. A low refund rate of 6% suggests strong customer satisfaction, while the COVID-19 lockdowns likely contributed to a 163% sales surge from 2019 to 2020. However, growth has since plateaued, prompting an analysis of past and current trends to identify strategies for sustained success.

### Sales Trends :

From 2019 to 2020, the average monthly sales were $585K, with 2,253 orders and an Average Order Value (AOV) of $260. 2020 was the strongest sales year, surpassing $10M in total revenue and averaging $846K in monthly sales. However, 2021 recorded the highest order volume at 35K, indicating a shift toward increased purchase frequency but with lower-value orders. 2020 also had the highest AOV at $300, suggesting that customers purchased more expensive products that year.

North America leads in total sales, contributing 51.79%, followed by Europe (29.25%), Asia-Pacific (13%), and Latin America (5.96%). The 27-inch 4K Gaming Monitor was the top-selling product across all regions, generating over $9 million in revenue.
Beyond gaming monitors, notable brand preferences emerged:
* Apple Air Headphones dominated headphone sales, accounting for 28% of total revenue, while Bose SoundSport Headphones held a negligible 0.012% share.
* MacBook Air claimed 22% of total laptop sales, doubling its competitor, the ThinkPad Laptop (11%).

This strong brand favoritism suggests potential opportunities for strategic partnerships, pricing adjustments, or targeted marketing campaigns. Further analysis into customer sentiment, brand perception, and regional buying behavior could provide insights to refine Olo-Mango’s product positioning and promotional efforts.

### Growth Rates :

2020 was a standout year for Olo-Mango, with sales nearly tripling, orders doubling, and AOV increasing by 31%. The most significant surge occurred in March 2020, with sales growing over 50% and orders increasing 46% from the previous month—likely driven by heightened e-commerce demand during pandemic lockdowns.
However, this momentum was not sustained in the following years. 2021 recorded the highest order volume (35K), yet total sales fell short of 2020’s peak, indicating a shift toward lower-value purchases or smaller orders per customer. The declining AOV post-2020 suggests that the surge in high-ticket sales was temporary, and consumer demand has since normalized, potentially signaling a post-pandemic market correction.
