A low refund rate of 6% suggests strong customer satisfaction, while the COVID-19 lockdowns likely contributed to a 163% sales surge from 2019 to 2020.

From 2019 to 2020, the average monthly sales were $585K, with 2,253 orders and an Average Order Value (AOV) of $260. 2020 was the strongest sales year, surpassing $10M in total revenue and averaging $846K in monthly sales. However, 2021 recorded the highest order volume at 35K, indicating a shift toward increased purchase frequency but with lower-value orders. 2020 also had the highest AOV at $300, suggesting that customers purchased more expensive products that year.

### Geographical Insights :

North America leads in total sales, contributing 51.79%, followed by Europe (29.25%), Asia-Pacific (13%), and Latin America (5.96%). The 27-inch 4K Gaming Monitor was the top-selling product across all regions, generating over $9 million in revenue.
Beyond gaming monitors, notable brand preferences emerged:
* Apple Air Headphones dominated headphone sales, accounting for 28% of total revenue, while Bose SoundSport Headphones held a negligible 0.012% share.
* MacBook Air claimed 22% of total laptop sales, doubling its competitor, the ThinkPad Laptop (11%).

This strong brand favoritism suggests potential opportunities for strategic partnerships, pricing adjustments, or targeted marketing campaigns. Further analysis into customer sentiment, brand perception, and regional buying behavior could provide insights to refine Olo-Mango’s product positioning and promotional efforts.

### Growth Rates :

2020 was Olo-Mango’s strongest year, with sales nearly tripling, orders doubling, and AOV rising 31%. The largest spike occurred in March 2020, with a 50% sales increase—likely driven by pandemic-induced e-commerce demand. However, growth slowed post-2020. 2021 saw the highest order volume (35K), but total sales lagged behind, indicating a shift toward lower-value purchases. AOV declined after 2020, suggesting the high-ticket sales surge was temporary, with demand normalizing in a post-pandemic market.

### Loyalty Program

The loyalty program saw exceptional growth in 2020, with a 614% sales increase and 550% more orders. Since 2021, it has consistently outperformed regular members in sales and orders, and by 2022, it also surpassed them in AOV.

### Refund Rates

Apple products were a key driver of sales for OLO-Mango, with over 52,000 units sold and a low return rate of 6% (3,111 items). The AirPods Headphones accounted for most returns (2,636 items, 5%), indicating potential product or customer satisfaction concerns. Refund rates peaked in 2020 at 10% (1,853 items), likely due to the pandemic-driven surge in online shopping. However, 2021 saw a significant improvement, with the rate dropping to 4% (713 items). While 2022 currently reflects a 0% refund rate, a data validation with the payments team is necessary to confirm accuracy.
