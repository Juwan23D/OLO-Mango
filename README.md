# Overview

Between 2019 and 2022, OlO-Mango generated $28M in total sales from 108,000 orders, with an average order value (AOV) of $260. A low refund rate of 6% suggests strong customer satisfaction, while the COVID-19 lockdowns likely contributed to a 163% sales surge from 2019 to 2020. However, growth has since plateaued, prompting an analysis of past and current trends to identify strategies for sustained success.

### Sales Trends :

From 2019 to 2022, the average monthly sales were $585K, with 2,253 orders and an Average Order Value (AOV) of $260. 2020 was the strongest sales year, surpassing $10M in total revenue and averaging $846K in monthly sales. However, 2021 recorded the highest order volume at 35K, indicating a shift toward increased purchase frequency but with lower-value orders. 2020 also had the highest AOV at $300, suggesting that customers purchased more expensive products that year.

### Geographical Insights :

North America leads in total sales, contributing 51.79%, followed by Europe (29.25%), Asia-Pacific (13%), and Latin America (5.96%). The 27-inch 4K Gaming Monitor was the top-selling product across all regions, generating over $9 million in revenue.
Beyond gaming monitors, notable brand preferences emerged:
* Apple Air Headphones dominated headphone sales, accounting for 28% of total revenue, while Bose SoundSport Headphones held a negligible 0.012% share.
* MacBook Air claimed 22% of total laptop sales, doubling its competitor, the ThinkPad Laptop (11%).

This strong brand favoritism suggests potential opportunities for strategic partnerships, pricing adjustments, or targeted marketing campaigns. Further analysis into customer sentiment, brand perception, and regional buying behavior could provide insights to refine Olo-Mango’s product positioning and promotional efforts.

### Growth Rates :

2020 was Olo-Mango’s strongest year, with sales nearly tripling, orders doubling, and AOV rising 31%. The largest spike occurred in March 2020, with a 50% sales increase—likely driven by pandemic-induced e-commerce demand. However, growth slowed post-2020. 2021 saw the highest order volume (35K), but total sales lagged behind, indicating a shift toward lower-value purchases. AOV declined after 2020, suggesting the high-ticket sales surge was temporary, with demand normalizing in a post-pandemic market.

### Loyalty Program

The loyalty program saw exceptional growth in 2020, with a 614% sales increase and 550% more orders. Since 2021, it has consistently outperformed regular members in sales and orders, and by 2022, it also surpassed them in AOV.

### Refund Rates

Apple products were a key driver of sales for OLO-Mango, with over 52,000 units sold and a low return rate of 6% (3,111 items). The AirPods Headphones accounted for most returns (2,636 items, 5%), indicating potential product or customer satisfaction concerns. Refund rates peaked in 2020 at 10% (1,853 items), likely due to the pandemic-driven surge in online shopping. However, 2021 saw a significant improvement, with the rate dropping to 4% (713 items). While 2022 currently reflects a 0% refund rate, a data validation with the payments team is necessary to confirm accuracy.

# Reccomendations

### Sales :

* The rise of gaming and content creation post-2020 has created an opportunity to bundle high-performance products like the 4K gaming monitor, MacBook, and Apple headphones. As many are still unfamiliar with the best equipment for social media ventures, we will test tailored combinations such as a gaming bundle, content creation pack, and travel tech parcel. OLO will also educate consumers on how key product features meet their needs, empowering their choices and building stronger relationships.

* Apple has a brand preference compared to the other products so establishing a business relationship could help marketing efforts. Gaining access to more Apple products such as cases, watches, chargers, and services such as Apple certified - tech support, trade in programs, and purchase recommendations, can help OLO-Mango leverage Apples premium brand perception for various marketing campaigns.

### Geography :

* The regional variance in performance suggests OLO-Mango’s brand recognition outside North America needs improvement. I recommend a marketing research campaign for the EMEA, LATNAM, and APAC regions, using surveys to understand customer sentiment, local preferences, and opportunities for website localization. By examining cultural influences, such as the perception of designs as status symbols, the Marketing Team can tailor campaigns, while the Web Development Team can optimize the site for each market.

### Growth Rates :

* To drive growth, OLO-Mango should strengthen its brand position. The unpredictable spikes of 2020 highlight the risks of relying on volatility. A steady approach can be achieved by optimizing social media to showcase products in action, share customer reviews, and educate consumers on technology. Offering budget-friendly options and running seasonal promotions, like a holiday sale in November/December and a Spring Sale in March, can offset slower growth months.

### Loyalty Program :

* OLO-Mango should keep its loyalty program, as it’s outperforming non-loyal members. Adding personalized rewards, tiered benefits, a points system for repeat purchases, and incentivizing customers to share on social media will increase engagement and attract new members

### Refund Rates :

* To reduce returns, implement a survey to understand why customers are returning Apple Headphones—whether it's due to defects, sound quality, or usability issues. Offering product guides and extended support can also reduce the need for refunds. Lastly, confirm the 2022 refund rate with the Payments and Logistics teams
